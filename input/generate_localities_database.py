Title: generate_localities_database.py
Author: Nicholas Summons, nicholas.summons@ga.gov.au
CreationDate: 2012-02-16
Description: Generates country/division/locality database from text file provided on the
"world-gazetteer.com" website.  The database is used by the configuration editor GUI
to determine place names and location coordinates.
