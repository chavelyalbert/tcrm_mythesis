Title: pathLocator.py
Author: Nicholas Summons, nicholas.summons@ga.gov.au  (Adapted from code snippet found on online forum)
CreationDate: 18-10-2011
Description: A function to determine the directory one level above the Utilities folder.
             Designed to work even if the code has been compiled with py2exe.  This results in the modules
             being built-in to the interpreter, so the path of the executable is returned instead.
